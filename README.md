# Flower Classification K Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbor is a supervised classification algorithm used to assign a class to new data point. KNN can be used for both regression and classification tasks.
Algorithm:
- Compute the distance between the new data point with every training example.
- Distance measures include Euclidean distance, Hamming distance or Manhattan distance.
- Model picks K entries in the data which are closest to the new data point.
- Algorithm performs majority vote i.e the most common class/label among those K entries will be the class of the new data point.
